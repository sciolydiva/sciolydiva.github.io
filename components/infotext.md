Are you interested in _coding, biology, engineering,_ and more? If you
are, you’d be the perfect fit for our new _Science Olympiad_
division exclusively for _elementary school students_! You’ll have the
opportunity to learn about all things science by doing hands-on projects with
help from Albany high school and middle school Science Olympians. We’ll be
“assigning” projects at the beginning of the month and will follow through by
hosting zooms where students can learn more about the topic and show off their
work. Currently, we are planning on remote instruction, but hope to start
in-person events in the next school year. This is open to all grade levels,
including rising kindergarteners. If you are interested and would like to sign
up head over to the sign up form and please email any questions or concerns to
_scioly.div.a@gmail.com_!
