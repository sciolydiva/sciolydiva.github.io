        Are you interested in <em>coding, biology, engineering,</em> and more?
        If you are, you’d be the perfect fit for our new
        <em>Science Olympiad</em>
        division exclusively for <em>elementary school students</em>! You’ll
        have the opportunity to learn about all things science by doing hands-on
        projects with help from Albany high school and middle school Science
        Olympians. We’ll be “assigning” projects at the beginning of the month
        and will follow through by hosting zooms where students can learn more
        about the topic and show off their work. Currently, we are planning on
        remote instruction, but hope to start in-person events in the next
        school year. This is open to all grade levels, including rising
        kindergarteners. If you are interested and would like to sign up head
        over to the sign up form and please email any questions or concerns to
        <em>scioly.div.a@gmail.com</em>!
